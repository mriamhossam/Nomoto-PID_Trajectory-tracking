# Nomoto-PID_Trajectory-tracking
Based on the first-order Nomoto model and an improved PID controller, the project realizes real-time tracking control and visualization of a given trajectory (CSV historical point column), and exports key timing data (position, heading angle, rudder angle) to Excel for subsequent analysis.
